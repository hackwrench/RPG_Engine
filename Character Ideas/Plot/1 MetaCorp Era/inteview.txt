Arin:  This is Arin Spater, outside the main complex of O.R. Corp City.
 
  where Sir Louis Leon Paladin is about to announce a new breakthrough
   
  in technological advances, opening up a new field of science,
 
  Meta Technology.  Here is Sir Louis now.


Sir Louis:  Please feel free to call me LLP as all my friends do.
   
The O.R. Corp has perfected a new storage process,
   
This new computer technology allows anything, including human beings,
   
to be stored by this process.
   
My daugher will be the first person to be stored by this new technique.

she could last for years in this state...but she will only be stored for a

few seconds.  I expect inustry to embrace this new technology.

[Arlyn enters the Meta device chamber. She disappears. Minutes pass]

A minor fault has developed in the Meta re-emergence unit.

My daughter is perfectly safe, I assure you.

Arin: Well, there you have it, folks.  For those of you who have just tuneed

in, Louis Leon Paladin of the O. R. Corp.'s announcement of the new Meta

device has just been followed by the distressing failure of one of

the device's key components, with his daughter inside.

[In Paladin's private quarters]

Paladin:  Hess, I thoght you fully understood how the Meta device worked.

Hess:  I did, S-sir, Flynn Zander must have had some sort of failsafe

mechanism, preventing the device from being operated.

Paladin: Make sure you get my daughter out of there.  Do you know how much
 
  this could set back our plans.

Hess:  Yes-s Sir,  I'll get right on it, sir.

Paladin: That accursed Zander.  I'll make sure he pays dearly for this.

The Zanders have a daughter.  Paladin has her kidnapped.

Years pass... Traci has a son... then another daughter.
