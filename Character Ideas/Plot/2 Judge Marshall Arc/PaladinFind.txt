[Curtains open,  Simon Expo enters, looks around, and every so often

picks something up, admires it, and stows it upon his person]


Dark Warrior:  Who are you?  What are you doing in my house


Simon Expo:  Don't mess with me man, I'll shoot you

[Simon Expo shoots Dark Warrior, Arlyn enters, alarmed]


Arlyn:  You killed my father.


Simon Expo:  He was going to kill me, and besides nobody knows what this
 
  gun thing does anyway...  He might still be alive somehow.


Arlyn:  He was NOT going to kill you


Simon Expo:  Oh well, can't be helped now


Arlyn:  Oh well, can't be helped now?!?  That was MY father you decided to
 
  test that thing on.  What's your name and where did you get it from anyway,
 
  you OBVIOUSLY didn't make it yourself.


Simon Expo:  My name's Simon Expo and I took it from an evil scientist.


Arlyn:  Evil scientist, Yeah, Right, You probably don't even know
 
  what an evil scientist looks like...

[Sir Louis Leon Paladin enters]

Arlyn:  You wouldn't happen to know a tall, dark thin man dressed in
 
  red,  would you?


Simon Expo:  Funny, Now that you mention it, that fits the description
 
  of that evil scientist guy EXACTLY.


Arlyn:  Well, You had better look behind you.


Sir Louis Leon Paladin:  Greetings, my name is Sir Louis Leon Paladin
 
  Arlyn, you probably don't remember me, but I am your real father.

  [Adresses Simon Expo]
 
  As for you, it is nice to know that fools are dependable, I let you steal
 
  this weapon, and you'll be happy to know that with it, you managed to
 
  dispose of one of my most formidable opponents.  As your reward, I will
 
  make your death most unpleasant.

[He freezes Simon Expo and then turns to address Arlyn]
 
  Come along now there's no use screaming for help

[They exit] 


Arlyn:  Jeanny... Jeanny...


Jeanny Cauldron:  Yes, Dear, what do you want?

   [Then, noticing the frozen form of Simon Expo]
  
   Oh dear, He's frozen, isn't he?  I shoud unfreeze him, shoudn't I
 
  [She unfreezes him and says]
 
  All right you, but I'm not done with you, yet.  What has happened to
 
  Arlyn?


Simon Expo:  [still cold from being frozen and nervous]

  Sir, Sir, Louis Leon Paladin took her.


Jeanny Cauldron:
 
  Don't just sit there, show me the way.

[They exit, Sir Louis and Arlyn enter]


Sir Louis: [casting a remembrance spell]

  You have forgotten, but now you will remember. 

Arlyn:  [Jumping back, remembering,] You forced me into the Meta device.

Sir Louis:  Now, now, a small mistake, hadn't I been a good father to you
 
   in the past?

Arlyn:  Yes, but you were a vile, vile man.  With your plans to take over

  the earth...


Sir Louis:  Say no more, if you don't act like a good daughter I will

  lock you in this room until you can behave.
 
  [He leaves, and the image of Dark Warrior enters.]


Dark Warrior:  Help me...I am in a most terrible place.  Arlyn, I can see

  you faintly, make a sign if you can hear me... you're image is breaking up.

  [Dark Warrior exits, Simon and Jeanny enter]


Arlyn:  You've found me.  My father, I saw him, he's stuck in a Meta Zone.

Jeanny:  If we all concentrate hard, we can bring him back.

[Dark Warrior enters]


Dark Warrior:  You have all saved me, thank you.


Arlyn:  I love you, Dad, and I'm glad I'm a Marshall


Arlyn:[As they all leave]  I wonder what happened to Paladin
