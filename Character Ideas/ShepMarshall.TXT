Dark?
Dark Warrior
War Sage
Motivation for taking in Arlyn:
Responsibility?
Aesthetics?
Afraid of what he would turn into without something else to balance him out?
 What events would lead him to this fear
 Lack of a "home life" without someone there to take care of?
Sheer incredulity of the circumstances of discovering Arlyn.
 How does Arlyn being a blank in the system affect his world view?
 The idea of someone unintentionally becoming a blank in the system
 would have been unfanthomable to him before encountering Arlyn.
 Lack of data on her in the system would lead him to construct the
 hypothesis that someone destroyed the information on her for some purpose.
 As the author of this scenario, I have to figure out how to get him
 from that point to the realization (discovery?)
 that she had never been in the system.
 What are the obstacles in his mind that hinder him from accepting evidence
 that supports the reality?
 What evidence can we generate within the reality of the storyline
 that forces him to confront those obstacles in his mind?
 
 Shep Marshall starts calling himself War Sage after the Meta Control Program takes Arlyn away again for as yet unknown reasons.
