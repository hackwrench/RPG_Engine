I've combined the data from a few games and am developing
a workable combination

QBASM.ASM contains the routinesthat will run in the IDE
ASM.ASM contains the routines that run in the compiled version
EDITASM.BAT Loades both using the EDIT.COM that came with Win 95
and then compiles them, and then moves the QBASM.QLB to ASM.QLB
