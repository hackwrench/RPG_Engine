'FROM:    KARINA MISTER(WPBS12B)
'How would you all like to see a Final Fantasy-style RPG game
'engine? The overworld maps would be in SCREEN 7 text, but
'the battle scenes would use REAL graphics (SCREEN 7, again,
'but hey, I'm posting this on $P$rodigy!). You would control
'3 characters: Kyta, Glenlin, and Kohlen. One is a fighter,
'one a mage, and the other a ninja. Think of treasure chests
'(some of them containing monsters!), weapon/armor shops,
'inns, 12 magic spells, and a rather short and abrupt
'storyline. Think of battles against foes, changing
'background graphics, and, best of all, the ability to edit
'it to make ANYTHING YOU WANT out of it RPG-wise.
'                                                 [>]
'Think of a few days, 2 weeks at most. I've already started,
'and I'm about 60% done (in two days!). Here's what's left:
'* Weapon/armor shop
'* Inn
'* Interactive battle scenes
'* Talking to the king
'That's it!
'It's already pretty large, and I'm not sure how much larger
'it will get. However, I will either post it here, send it
'out via email, or BOTH. It's completely self-contained, but
'only because I'm posting it on $P$rodigy (or thinking about
'it, anyway). It can be converted to data files without any >
'problem. Anyway, though, reply here and tell me what you
'think. Here's a taste of what it'll be like: the SPELLS!
'CURE         Recover HP in one party member
'HEAL " in all party members                         "
'FIRE         Fire attack
'ICE          Ice attack
'LIGHTNING    Lightning attack
'TREMOR       Earth attack
'DROWN        Water attack
'WALL         Block spells
'LIFE         Bring back to life
'[>]
'QUAKE        Major earth attack against all enemies
'PHASE        Major attack against all enemies
'TIDAL WAVE   Major water attack against all enemies
'

'OK, I'm ALMOST done. Here's what remains:
'* Enemies still need to be able to cast HEAL, PENETRATE, and
'  TREMOR.
'* You still need to be able to get experience and gold from
'  defeating enemies (piece of cake to program).
'* You still need to be able to run from battles (no prob).
'* You still need to be able to camp (no prob).
'* The weapon/armor shop and inventory screen still need to
'  be created.
'* The game over screen (NOTICE: you are dead) still needs
'  to be created.
'That's IT! It may sound like a lot, but trust me:    [>]
'compared to what I've already done, that's dust on the
'floor!

'Also, I may or may not be sending copies via Internet email.
'It may be easier to just send via $P$rodigy email.

'Finally, it's done! :) The following 30 subjects contain the
'source code to one of the most complex RPG's ever posted on
'this bb. The battle scenes are similar to those in Final
'Fantasy II, with 3 characters battling 1 to 4 enemies, the
'strongest characters moving first. There are many different
'types of attacks, as well: 3 different weapon attacks, 3
'different beam attacks, 2 different star attacks, a jumping
'attack, and 12 magic spells. Each spell uses an elemental to
'inflict damage, and if the enemy is weak against that
'elemental, it will receive up to 3x as much damage. However,
'if the enemy is STRONG against that elemental, it will GAIN
'life instead of losing it.       [>]
'There's also the ever-popular WALL spell, which will NOT
'ONLY *block* the enemies' spells, but also BOUNCE THEM BACK
'at the enemy! And new spells are learned as you gain levels!
'Of course, this game also has the usual RPG elements:
'weapon/armor shops, status screens, HP, MP, GP, inns,
'campgrounds, a storyline, and a shocking final battle.
'
'Best of all... this game runs from an RPG game engine, which
'can be easily EDITED to make... you guessed it... your OWN
'RPG!!!
'
'Please reply with any and all comments, and HAVE FUN!   ~T~
