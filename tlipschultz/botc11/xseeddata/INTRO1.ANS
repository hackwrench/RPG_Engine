[5C[1;32mAn audience has been requested by the benevolent [33mKing Matthew [32mof your
homeland, [33mTeras Manor[32m. You eagerly approach the throne room, anxious to hear
what he has to say (for he has been summoning the manor's best warriors into
his chambers all day). Upon your arrival, he presents you with a chair and
asks for a moment of your time.
[5C[36m"As you may already know, the dark shapeshifter known only as [31mChameleon
[36mhas been causing some problems in the neighboring land of [37mVulteria[36m." [32mYou nod
your head. The name of [31mChameleon [32mis virtually the only gossip in the land at
the current time. The king continues: [36m"The [37mShagwood Druids [36mhave been brutally
slaughtered by one of its minions, and it's unknown as to whether or not there
are any survivors remaining. The [37mDelidian Royal Guard [36mhas been chased from the
castle by another one of the shapeshifter's dark servants. The [37mPhoraxian King
[36mhas been possessed, by all appearances. And a band of explorers recently
vanished in the [37mEagle Mountain Caves[36m. Truly this [31mChameleon [36mhas plagued that
peaceful land long enough, and it's time [33mTeras Manor [36mlent a hand. I have
summoned you here to ask that you help us."
