Although it looks like an empty room, the walls all around you are actually
servers. Yes, this is the hub of XSEED's evil empire: the Server Room of Doom!

Standing before you is Jun Iwasaki, president of XSEED. He is often referred to
as 'JI the JIant' -- not because he's larger than anyone else (that would
require re-drawing the ANSI art here!), but because he's a lean, mean fighting
machine. Only the toughest can ever hope to defeat him!
