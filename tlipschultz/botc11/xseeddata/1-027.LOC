You are startled to see a huge eagle flapping its wings in the middle of this
room. You stare into its eyes and see some form of superhuman understanding and
power. This is no ordinary eagle, and it's no enemy of yours.

There is a very large hole in the ceiling here, apparently the means in which
the eagle arrived. You can go north from here, or you can attempt to ride the
eagle.

The eagle seems to sense your anxiety. It knows why you're here. It's here to
help you. All you have to do is give it your trust.
/
The hole is too high to reach by normal means, but with an eagle on your side,
you might just make it!

The eagle sits there, staring at you.

The only way to go up from here is to ride the eagle (press X).

Mmmmm. Dirt.

The eagle is silent, except for the incessant beating of its wings.
