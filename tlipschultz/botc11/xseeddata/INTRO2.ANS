[32mAt that moment, a cloaked figure stepped out from the shadows.

[36m"Ah, you're here already, [0;36mGlenlin[1m! ... New warrior, I'd like you to meet the
 Terasian wizard, [0;36mGlenlin[1m. He will use his magic to transport you to Vulteria
 when you are ready to go. Once you've arrived, your goal is to [33mFIND THE FOUR
 ELEMENTAL TEARS[36m, the only items which can destroy the magical barriers that
 the [31mChameleon [36mhas constructed near his mountaintop lair. It is rumored that
 the shapeshifter himself holds two other multi-elemental tears with awesome
 powers. If you find these, you may keep them and use their powers for your
 own benefit. Now, I will give you a [37mDagger [36mand [37mLeather Jerkin [36mfor this quest.
 [0;36mGlenlin [1mwill handle the rest. Are you ready to go?"
