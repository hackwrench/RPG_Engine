You begin descending the long ladder leading to X-Bot's domain. Partway down,
however, you're stopped by a brown barrier. You'll need brown blood to melt
a path through it... for some reason. I'm not really sure how that works,
but use your imagination, OK? Suspend that disbelief! Suspend it BUT GOOD!

There's a cubby-hole off to the side, just big enough to hold a weapon.

There's no way through the barrier without the proper blood... for some reason.
