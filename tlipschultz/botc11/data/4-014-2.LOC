Aha! It seems that that dead-end room WAS useful after all! Before you lit it
up, this room was just an east-west passage. But now, you can see that there's
also an exit to the north. Perhaps the wall in the north was just a mirage
before, or maybe the lighting of the dead-end room triggered some kind of
switch. At any rate, you can now go north from here.

That wasn't there before. Lighting the dead-end room must've triggered it. How
cool!
