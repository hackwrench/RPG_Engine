You are in the Eagle Shrine, where brave explorers stop to rest after hours of
spelunking. The Eagle Guru stands before you, ready to train you at a moment's
notice. Speak with him often, for his help and services may mean the difference
between life and death during future travels.

The Shrine overlooks Shagwood Forest, and you have a clear view of a large gray
building far in the distance. The only exit is to the west.

This shrine is one of the most famous there is. Feel proud to be here.
/
Speak often with the guru, for he can resurrect you when you die, and he can
heal your wounds when you live. He can also bestow his power upon you...
/
You have an exceptional view of Shagwood, forest of sorcery, from here.
The view is probably even better to the west, however.
/
+8
Although scenic, it's not possible to exit from here. Go west (4).
+2
Mountainous crags block you in that direction. Press 4 to go west.
+6
An endless fall, blocked by pillars. Press 4 to go west.

You're about as high up as you can get (until much later, anyway).
++
The Guru doesn't seem to want you to kiss his feet.
