There is a large pit on the north side of this room. From below, you can
see the beautiful blue glint of water: a promise of survival for those who
dare to jump down into the pit. Be sure to explore thoroughly this cavern
before you leap, and recall that this pit probably leads to the same place
as the pit on the other side of the north wall.

There are exits to the west and east.

From the look and sound of things, there's probably water down there, so it's
a safe bet that you'll survive if you jump. Be certain that you've explored
Eagle thoroughly before jumping, however, 'cause there's no way back up!
