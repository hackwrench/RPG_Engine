Whoa! There are some REALLY WEIRD markings on the ground here! They're made
with a strange watery substance, but it's DEFINITELY not water. The wall of
Cair Delidia is to the east, and there are tall impassable mountains to the
north and west -- could this be the legendary 'Dark Mountain' area?

The only direction you can go from here is south.

|03Is it chalk?
|03  Is it powder?
|03    Or perhaps it's... power?
|03Who made these markings?
|03  Who cares?
|03    Their power is yours...

You bend down to take a closer look. Why not (E)xamine these markings?
