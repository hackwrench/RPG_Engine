You're standing outside an open building (presumably a shop). In front of
the shop you see a loitering civilian. To the west is a shallow man-made
lake which, upon closer inspection, turns out to be a HEALING POOL! There's
also more city to the south and east.

Healing... Lake?

Hmmm... seems to extend pretty far to the west, and it looks like there's
something glinting in the sun in the middle of it...

At any rate, knowing its healing properties, you take a drink.

|14"Wooo! I really enjoy my new Powder Flash, and you will too, if you
|14purchase it here, at Bob's Powder Flash Emporium! In a land as savage as
|14Phorax, nothing's as big a life-saver as a Powder Flash! (And here's a
|14word to the wise, bub: there's something IN THE LAKE you might be
|14interested in too, if you get my drift... the water's shallow, you know...
|14wink wink, nudge nudge...)"
