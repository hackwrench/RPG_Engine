There's a VERY VERY LARGE VILLAGER standing here. You can see the faint traces
of a beach to the northeast, suggesting water nearby. The castle wall blocks
your way to the west, but you can still travel north, south, or east from
here.

|14"I know many secrets about this land. Right now, I know this much: the
|14troubles at Cair Delidia are being caused by a giant slime. You can beat it
|14only by attacking its core -- and to do that, you need to swim through the
|14rest of its body, which requires some sort of breathing apparatus. Talk to
|14me again later, after you've defeated this slime."
