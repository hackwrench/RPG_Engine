|14"Have you seen the strange markings on the ground at the westernmost point
|14in Delidia? They spook me out every time I see them. That area is called
|14'Dark Mountain' by the locals. Once, I saw somebody drop out of the sky and
|14land right in the middle of those strange markings. I had to change my pants
|14when I got home. And believe me, getting home in that state was no walk in
|14the park! But, I've said too much now."
