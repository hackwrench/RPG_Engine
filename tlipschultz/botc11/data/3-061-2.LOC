It's King Bloodthorne's throne room! There are two guards stationed here,
and far in the distant north sits King Bloodthorne himself -- at least, an
imposter of the king. A red curtain seems to be draped over the wall beyond
the king's throne.

The guards are carefully watching you.

Yep, they're guards. And they don't seem to want to let you get past them.

The king sits far in the distance in his throne. Too bad it's not really King
Bloodthorne...
/
There's something strange about that curtain, but you can't quite put your
finger on it...
