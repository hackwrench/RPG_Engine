There's a red-robed old man here. The only exit is to the south.

|11STRANGE OLD MAN
|14"Ahoy there! I'm King Bloodthorne's son, Arthur! The king locked me in
|14this horrid prison of a room, presumably to die. He is not himself, that's
|14to be sure. But I cannot fight my own father. I'll make a deal with you:
|14if you've enough money, I'll sell you my weapon. I don't need it anymore."
