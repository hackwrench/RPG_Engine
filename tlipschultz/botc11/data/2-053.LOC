One of the locals is here, in another unfurnished room (seems these Vulterian
people don't care much for decor). There are exits to the north and east.

(T)alk. Don't examine. Believe me, nobody likes to be examined. Well, I
suppose SOME people do... but nobody in this game does. I hope. If you're one
of those people who like to be examined, though, and you're female, and you
live in the Collegeville, Pennsylvania area... drop me a line, baby. (:
See the exit ANSI for the email address. RREEOOWW!! (:

|14"A giant slime has taken over Cair Delidia in the west... and the castle
|14guards are helpless against it. The gate to the castle was closed to seal
|14the slime inside, and the key was placed in the guard chamber. Unfortunately,
|14a strange purple light began to emanate from the guard chamber a short while
|14later. The castle guards tried to investigate, but were unable to enter: a
|14curse had been placed on the room, keeping all humans out. So now the castle
|14is nothing more than a locked tomb! If only we had the Amulet..."
