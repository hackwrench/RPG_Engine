|14"I am the Being. I know all that has happened in this Labyrinth over the
|14years, and I know all that is to come. There IS a Minotaur here, sent by
|14The Chameleon. I sense that you must fight this Minotaur someday, to get
|14the Crystal Tear it holds. I know others have tried to fight it, and failed.
|14Their weapons and armor were left behind on their bloody remains. I found
|14these instruments of battle in my travels and placed them in chests around
|14the Labyrinth for warriors like you to one day find. Thus, I wish you luck."
