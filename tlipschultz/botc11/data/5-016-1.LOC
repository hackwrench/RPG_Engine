You are at the very center of the gray building, but instead of finding an
entrance, you find... a smooth white metal ramp?! It seems to lead up to the
roof, and looks too smooth and slippery to climb, but it's the only way up.
Besides the ramp to the north, the only exit is the forest path in the west
that you just came from.

Ramp

The ramp leads up to the roof of this mid-sized building, which appears to be
the exit to the great Labyrinth.

The ramp seems to be incredibly smooth. It's very doubtful that you'll be able
to make it all the way to the top from here.
