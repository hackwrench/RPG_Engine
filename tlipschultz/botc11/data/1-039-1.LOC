You are swimming in a stream with a fast-moving northern current, apparently
created by the huge waterfall to the north. The easiest way out is to just go
down the falls and follow the example of the rocks floating downstream.

The current is moving so fast that falling down the waterfall would probably
toss you far away from the bottom. This is a good thing, since you can see
the stream continuing below, then coming to an abrupt stop in the middle of
a large cavern. Go for it!
/
The rocks are scattered at random along the water. They seem to be coming from
the south.

It's composed primarily of water.
