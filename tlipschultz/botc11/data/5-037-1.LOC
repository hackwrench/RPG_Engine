You are standing in the Shagwood Shrine, meditation and training spot for all
aspiring magicians. The only exit is to the north (8). The Shagwood Guru
stands before you, ready to help you get stronger. (T)alk to him often,
whenever you feel weak or tired!

The shrine is perfectly situated amidst a grove of trees so that it is only
visible from the north.

Speak with this guru often! He can heal your wounds, protect you from death,
and teach you the magic of Fire!

|14"Welcome to my Shrine, adventurer. I shall now heal your wounds and teach
|14you the battle spell of Fire. Use it wisely, and remember that it only does
|14significant damage against beings of ice! I shall also now form a link with
|14you -- if you are to perish in these lands, I will know, and I will revive
|14you here when the clock strikes midnight!"
