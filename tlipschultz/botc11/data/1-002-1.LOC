You are standing in the middle of a very large temple: the Eagle Shrine. To
your east, you can see the main portion of the Shrine, where the Eagle Guru
awaits. To the north, a long ladder leads down into Shagwood. There is also
a hole in the ground here, leading to further adventures down below! Press +
to go down the hole.

The drop is fairly big, but not big enough to cause any real damage. It looks
like there's an entire system of caverns down there, but you probably won't
be able to get back up here if you drop down. It's your choice.
/
The ladder seems fairly sturdy up here, but it's LOOOOOOOONG. It leads down
into the very heart of Shagwood, some hundred feet below. Although it seems to
be very well-built, no feat of mankind could possibly maintain structural
soundness throughout such an incredibly long ladder.
/
You're standing in the middle of the famous Eagle Shrine, which is situated
upon the highest peak in Vulteria. The guru, wisest of the wise, is standing
in the eastern part of this shrine, close enough to see you but far enough
away that your voice cannot possibly reach him. He will prove a valuable ally
in your quest.
/
The view to the south, west, and east consists of only mountains, but to the
north it's tremendous! You can see the incredible forest of sorcery, Shagwood,
in all its glory. Far in the back of this forest you can see a mid-sized gray
building. Closer to you and to the east you can see a tree of amazing size.
