A castle guard stands before you, but doesn't seem to mind that you're here.
AT ALL. Which seems kinda odd, seeing as how you're just as likely to be a
thief as you are an adventurer. Hmm... what's going on?

Examining a docile guard might be a good way to undocilize him. I wouldn't do
that if I were you. (:

|11GUARD
|14"Halt? Why should you halt? We were stationed throughout the castle by
|14King Bloodthorne a mere 12 hours before he was possessed by The Chameleon's
|14minion, or whatever the hell happened to him. He knew something was going
|14to occur, and I guess we weren't any help at all in stopping it. Whoever
|14you are, you certainly can't make matters any WORSE, so go on ahead and
|14have fun. Just be careful, OK? I don't wanna have to hose blood off the
|14castle walls again."
