|14"Hello there, stranger! I hope I can offer you my services, but all I do is
|14sew. I love sewing, and continue to sew until I cut myself, at which time I
|14rub an herb on my finger and take away the pain. I keep one herb in a safe
|14place at all times just in case a weary traveler like you happens to come
|14along. If you can find it, it's yours."
