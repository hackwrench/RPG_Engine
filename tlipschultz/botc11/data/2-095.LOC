You're inside the peaceful Delidian Shrine, renowned for its powers of healing.
The Delidia Guru stands here, meditating. Speak with him often, for he can
heal your wounds, teach you magic to heal your OWN wounds, and provide you
with resurrection services should you die in battle. But, none of that can
happen unless you (T)alk to him!

The Shrine's only exit is to the north (8).

|14"Rise, my pupil! I will heal your wounds and make you well again! I also can
|14teach you the most powerful healing spell in existence, though perhaps you
|14are not yet strong enough to cast it -- most people aren't. Nonetheless, you
|14will know it, and it may save your life one day. In addition, I will form a
|14psychic bond with you now. If you die, I will revive you within 24 hours."
