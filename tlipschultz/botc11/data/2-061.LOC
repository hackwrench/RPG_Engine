You're in an alley between the wall of Cair Delidia and the wall of a local
shop. A VERY VERY LARGE MAN is standing in front of you. You can go north or
south.

|14"Years ago, Delidia and Phorax were one and the same. It wasn't until evil
|14creatures invaded Phorax that we Delidians split away from them. But even
|14now, the two lands are culturally and spiritually connected. Anything you
|14can't find here, you most likely can find there... and anything you can't
|14find there, you most likely can find here."
