You are standing in a forest clearing. The Shagwood Shrine is to the south and
there are forest paths stretching out to the north, east, and west. A lone
wizard stands before you, eyeing you carefully. Is he friend or foe?

Lone Wizard
Shrine

He is staring at you. The only part of his body visible is his face. The rest
is cloaked in gray robes.
/
The lost shrine of Shagwood, a treasure trove for weary adventurers, is to the
south. Visit its guru often!

|11LONE WIZARD
|14"Greetings, traveler! My name is Isbot. I, like you, am on a quest. But I
|14have been injured in my travels, and the Shagwood Guru is helping me heal.
|14Do not make the same mistake I did. I got lost in the forest, away from all
|14civilization. Make a map of your travels through Shagwood. Believe me, it
|14will help you immensely. Shagwood is a big place. If you're not careful, it
|14may be your final resting place, like that poor warrior whose tomb rests far
|14in the north, behind the gray building..."
