|14"There's a powerful weapon and a powerful magic in Shagwood that you cannot
|14acquire through normal means, for both are located high above the rest of
|14the forest. If you're daring, however, you may be able to leap upon them
|14from above. But choosing the right jump point and the right direction to
|14jump -- THAT is the challenge. And no, Mr. Smarty-Pants, I'm not trying to
|14give you a hint by saying 'right' instead of 'correct', so don't even
|14go there. (God, some people are so literal!)"
