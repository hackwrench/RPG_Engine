You see an abandoned mine car here in front of a rather large gaping cave
entrance. Unfortunately, the track is electrified, and the minecar lock is
electronic and has been scrambled. You'll need to ride the minecar to enter
the mine, but you'll need a descrambler for the lock first.

Seems to be a pretty typical minecar, except for the wheel lock keeping it in
place... not to mention the electrified track it's on. You can't fake it: you
need to descramble that minecar lock in order to get into these caves.

The minecar lock is scrambled. You need to find a descrambler for it!
