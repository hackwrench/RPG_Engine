You've entered a local shop. The man behind the counter has a rather large
item next to him which you assume is the item for sale. There's also a rather
large purple box dangling from the ceiling here. You notice this because...
well... it's really strange!

The shop exit is to the south.

|05Maybe it's just something intangible...
|05Maybe the box is here to help you...
