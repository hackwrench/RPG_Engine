Wahoooooooooo!! You're in the air above Shagwood, and floating gently to the
ground! So now you have a choice: you can either float straight down or veer

The Shagwood Shrine is directly below you. To the north you can see a large
gray building. To the south you can see a long ladder. To the east and west
you can see large cliffs and clumps of foliage.
