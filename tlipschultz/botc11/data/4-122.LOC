A hidden room! And standing here, you see a very very fat man in a white toga.
There are exits to the east and west.

Fat Toga-Clad Man

He's trying to look all cool and mystical, but instead, he just looks fat.

|11BENEVOLENT WIZARD
|14"I know that some people develop jitters when they venture this far into the
|14Labyrinth. So I've devoted my life to helping them. If you're lost or if you
|14simply don't want to be here anymore, I can teleport you back down to the
|14very first floor of the Labyrinth, near the Eagle drop-off. But remember,
|14you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TELEPORT BACK, so make sure you want to do this
|14before you say yes! It'll take you a LONG TIME to get back here!"
