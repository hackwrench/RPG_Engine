Ewww! This must be the Minotaur, the deadly guardian of the Labyrinth! It
looks sad, but nonetheless, it wants to kill you -- and it holds the valuable
Crystal Tear, which you will need if you plan to find and kill The Chameleon!
Thus, your only real choice right now is to (F)ight for your life -- the only
other option is to run away to the east!

You study his facial features closely, then realize that that's a pretty
idiotic idea, seeing as how he's out to kill you and all. Maybe you should
just (F)ight him.
