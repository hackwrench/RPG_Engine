You've discovered a hidden room, and it's VERY cold down here. In front of you
lies an old coffin, no lid, with a red-cloaked red-eyed occupant. The occupant
appears to be very much alive, and is staring at you.

This place is creepy. There's a ladder leading back up, if you get scared.

Coffin
V... vampire?!

It's made of stone, and looks VERY old.
/
The red-cloaked occupant bears fangs, so you can only assume it's a vampire.
He doesn't look particularly threatening, though, for some reason... just
spooky.

He's tightly grasping an old book in his left arm.
