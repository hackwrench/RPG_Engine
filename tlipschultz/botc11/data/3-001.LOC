You've found the highest point in Phorax -- the upper precipice. To the
north, you have a splendid view of Shagwood Forest. If you could only
survive the fall somehow, you'd have a whole new land to explore!

To the east you can see an abandoned mine car, but only from a distance.
You'll have to actually GO there to examine it more closely. The stairs
leading back down are in the south.

They go back to Phorax City.

There are some areas of Shagwood you've never seen before, but which can be
clearly seen from such a high vantage point. It's too bad you can't survive
such a big fall... or CAN you?

Without the Float spell, it'd be suicide!

Ow! Note to self: don't walk into walls anymore.

I said this is the HIGHEST POINT, poindexter!

Not without the Float spell, nuh-uh -- you'd DIE!
