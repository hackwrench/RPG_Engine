Buildings on all sides! Good thing you don't have claustrophobia! But
seriously, this is a crowded street corner here, with a building to the east,
one to the southwest, and a shop entrance to the north. And as if it's not
crowded enough, there's a villager just kinda hanging out right in the middle
of the road. How rude!

If you weren't fairly certain that this person existed only to give you advice
and information, you'd bop 'em upside the head!
