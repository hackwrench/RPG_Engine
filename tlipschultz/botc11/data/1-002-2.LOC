You are in the middle of the ladder. It feels very sturdy as you climb higher,
but the rungs below you seem to be extremely fragile. It would be unwise to
climb down from here. Go up instead.

The ladder is so long that it seems to be losing some of its integrity due

impossible). Maybe a spell of some sort could assist you...

The rungs are too unsturdy. You would probably crash to the ground.
