There's a large hill here. At the top of the hill, you can see a hole in the
ground -- but unfortunately, the hill is rather steep, and there's no way in
hell you can climb it. Looks like you gotta go north.

There's a hole on the hill, but the hill is too steep to climb. Looks like
that hole is, basically, an exit -- not an entrance.

You can't climb the hill!

Try as you might, you can't reach the hole.
