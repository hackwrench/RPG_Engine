Hmm... this area seems mildly flooded. It seems as if a sort of makeshift
lake has been formed here. Upon closer inspection, you discover that it's
actually a HEALING POOL! One sip, and you'll be dancin' on the tables like
mad with energy! It seems to extend to the south for quite a distance, and
is apparently rather shallow. You can also go west or north from here.

Healing... Lake?

Seems to extend pretty far south, and it looks like there's something pretty
much in the middle of it, glinting in the sunlight.

Ah well... time to take a drink!
