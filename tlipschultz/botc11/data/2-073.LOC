This isn't QUITE the southwest corner of Delidia City, but it's close. There's
a small drop to the south, but it looks like you might hurt yourself if you
fell. Luckily, it seems that there are stairs leading down in the east, along
with a shop entrance! You can also go north, into the alley between the shop
and Cair Delidia.

Ehh, it's a little too far. Go east instead -- there are stairs there.
