What beautiful scenery! To the east, the shallows of the Delidian Sea and the
subsequent beaches. To the west, the very edge of Cair Delidia as its walls
kiss the sunlight with brightness and glory. And to the north, a cliff over-
looking the Shagwood Forest far, far below. Upon looking down, you see places
in Shagwood that you didn't even know existed. If only there were some way to
leap into the sky and fall to Shagwood without the inconvenience of dying...

From here, you can go south to return to reality.

Looks like you could walk right through 'em!

There's so much unexplored land down there... if only you could drop down and
not die in the process...

No, that would KILL you.

Not without the Float spell. Sorry, but you're no good when dead.

Is your name Hector Del Fuego Magellan? Do you talk to the sea? Do you find
washed-up wreaths and heroin packets? Do you have any idea what I'm talking
about? (: Go buy the album "Savatage: The Wake of Magellan." THEN you'll
understand. (:
