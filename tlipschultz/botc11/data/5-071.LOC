You see a very long ladder to the south here, leading up farther than the eye
can see, apparently to the very top of the Eagle Mountains. You can ascend this
ladder by pressing the - key. There are also forest paths to the east and west
and a small but impassable rise in the contour of the land to the north.

It doesn't seem too structurally sound, but you'll probably be able to make
it to the top...

Too smooth and slightly too high. You cannot climb it.

Press - to ascend the ladder.
