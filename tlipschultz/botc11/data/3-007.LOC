You see another damn blue-robed villager in front of you. Phorax is too
crowded -- never mind the fact that in real life this would be a SERIOUSLY
underpopulated area. (: You can go west, east, or south from here.

|14"Hmm hmm hmm, doo-bee-doo-wop whoom. Ack! Sorry, didn't see you there.
|14What was I just humming? An old children's song. I know the words, I'm
|14just a lazy, lazy man. Or *do* I know the words? Hmm... I think it goes
|14something like this: 'Deep in the mine, my sweet Valentine, is the old
|14King's crown (shake it down, shake it down). Wanna get in, my dear little
|14kin? Find the descrambler for the lock in the tunnels which you can get
|14into with the stone key from Delidia.' Dunno why it stops rhyming there."
