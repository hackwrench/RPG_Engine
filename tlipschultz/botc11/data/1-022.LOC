Well, here's something a bit different. There's a small cliff to the north
leading up to a whole new cavern, but the cliff is a little too smooth and
high to climb. There's also a torch on the east wall, burning with such
radiant beauty that it seems to be the source of light for this entire cave
system. It must have magical origins. The only other exit is to the south.

Looks like a lot of open space up there. What a shame that you can't get to
it from here!

|09to shed such brilliant light.
