Oooooook... You climb the ladder, and suddenly find yourself standing on a
small white pad on a purple platorm floating on a haze of gray matter. The
east, west, and south sides of the platform are blocked off by forcefields
of an even brighter purple, but the north side is completely open -- you can
walk right up the edge, and, perhaps, walk off completely. Your mind is
suddenly flooded with feelings of peace and bravery, and you're being urged
to leap from this platform by a voice with no body. You're assured that it's
completely safe. But, if you do so, there's no way back to Shagwood...

It's made of a strange purple metal. Nothing of the sort exists in Vulteria,
nor in the world (for that matter).
/
It seems to be oxygenated -- you get the impression that this place is NOT
naturally full of breathable air, and this gray matter is the result of
environmental conditioning. Whatever this place is, the people who built it
were technological geniuses...
/
These are completely impenetrable. You feel like you're in a prison of some
kind, and you're being led through a maze like a rat.
/
Seems to be a transporter pad. You came into this weird place through that
thing, so it's only reasonable that you could leave it the same way (if you're
yella, anyway). Just go down (+).
