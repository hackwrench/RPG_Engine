What a busy room! There are three holes in the ground here, all of them with
ladders leading down into separate tunnels. There is a blinding light streaming
in from a room in the south. And you can barely make out a small crack in the
west wall, dark as night in this room of light.

These three holes lead to three different places. Press [+] to investigate

You look through the exit on the south wall and see what appears to be the
light of day mixing with the pulsating energy of a force field!

Compared to this room, whatever's over there is REALLY dark.
