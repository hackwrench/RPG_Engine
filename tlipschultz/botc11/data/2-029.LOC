The walls of buildings are blocking your path to the south and east. You can
only go north or west from here. A red-robed villager is standing before you.

|11VILLAGER
|14"The ferryman at the Delidian Sea will take you wherever you tell him to
|14go. The question is, what is there to find in the Delidian Sea? Well, there
|14are two people who know: a child in Eagle Village, and a man named Doug in
|14our very own Delidia City. Seek these people out to find out where to go.
|14And by the way, be careful: there ARE vicious sea-creatures in those waters
|14that have to be taken into account."
