You're in a hidden wing of the Labyrinth. A small man dressed in red stands
here, emaciated. There is a locked door to the east, made of bronze. The only

Damn, this guy needs food or something! He must weigh, like, 20 lbs! He's a
TWIG!

You need a Bronze Key to open this (isn't it convenient how the metal the door
is made out of is ALWAYS the same as the material the key is made out of?).
