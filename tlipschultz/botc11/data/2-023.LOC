Uhhh, I think you just found the slime's Nucleus. Ye Gods, that thing is
GIGANTIC, and it looks rather... icky. You really have no choice: if you want
to salvage what's left of Cair Delidia, you have to (F)ight! If you don't,
on the other hand, you can always run away by going east. But that would be
rather cowardly, now, wouldn't it?

There seem to be passages to the west and north as well, but they're blocked
by the Nucleus!

It's big, red, and squishy. And rather dangerous. (F)ight it, dagnabbit!

The Nucleus is in your way! (F)ight it!
