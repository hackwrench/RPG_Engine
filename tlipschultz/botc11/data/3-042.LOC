|11VILLAGER
|14"Phorax is ruled by King Bloodthorne. Recently, he seemed agitated, as if
|14he knew that some devastating event would soon occur. A day later, he was
|14fine, but had an evil glint in his eye. It was on that day that the
|14monsters of Phorax grew in strength and numbers. Ever since then, he's
|14been different. He even donned a new crown, which has been labelled the
|14'Crown of Despair'. We can only hope that, one day, the old King
|14Bloodthorne will return to his people..."
