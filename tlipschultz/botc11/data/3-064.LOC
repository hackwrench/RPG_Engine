A local villager stands before you -- maybe you should (T)alk. The Phorax
Shrine is to the south, and a building entrance to the north. The city street
stretches east and west from here. What will you do?

(T)alk to the villager -- examining people generally is of no help to you!

The shrine is to the south (2). Go there often -- trust me!

|14"You new here? If so, you'll have a tough time surviving in these harsh
|14lands. My advice? First, go north into this generous man's house. He'll
|14give you a Short Sword. There's also a Longsword laying around this
|14village somewhere... might be worthwhile to look around for it. My second
|14piece of advice? The weakest enemies in Phorax are here: in the area near
|14the Phorax Shrine. Hang around here for a while -- at least until you've
|14gained a few levels. If you're hurt, talk to the Guru in the Shrine."
