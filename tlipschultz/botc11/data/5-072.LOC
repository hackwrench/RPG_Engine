Here you see a welcome sight: water! And not just any water... this is a
healing pool! One sip of this water will heal all of your wounds and restore
all of your magical stamina! AWRIGHT!! The healing pool seems to extend east,
as far as the eye can see, and it seems to be relatively shallow.

There are forest paths to the north and west.

You stare into the healing pool and talk to yourself, but immediately stop
