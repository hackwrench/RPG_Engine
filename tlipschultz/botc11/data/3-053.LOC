An old man stands before you. There's an open door in the north. You can
also go west or south from here.

Old Man

His age is probably somewhere between 50 and 150 -- you can't tell much more

|11OLD MAN
|14"Hello there, young adventurer! My name is Roy. I have something you might
|14be interested in taking in my house. Go on in! It's all yours! I find it
|14difficult and dangerous to use a cane to walk when it's magnetized, anyway.
|14Weapons being attracted to your means of transportation is... not a good
|14thing."
