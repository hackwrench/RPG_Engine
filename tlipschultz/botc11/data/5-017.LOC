A large overgrowth blocks your way to the west. However, there is a small drop
to the south which appears to lead on into the forest. Unfortunately, if you
drop off here, you won't be able to climb back up: the drop is just a little
too high for that. Explore this area thoroughly before dropping. The only
other path is to the east.

Hmmm... what could this gray building be? Perhaps the exit to the great Laby-
rinth, which is said to exist below Eagle and Shagwood? If so, the only way in
is through the roof.
