You're caught between a rock and a hard place -- quite literally. There are
mountains too steep to climb to the north, and there's a building wall to the
south. But, as if placed here by fate so this spot isn't a TOTAL waste, a
red-robed villager stands expectantly, waiting to be spoken with.

|14"Hi! Can I be your friend? I've had all my shots. I'm not terminally con-
|14tageous anymore. There's now only a 2% chance of anyone being stricken with
|14my unusual plague, and I like those odds! I just wish I could get into
|14Cair Delidia -- I want to make good friends with King Bluerose! If he's even
|14still alive, what with the curse on the gates and all. Nobody can get in
|14the castle to check on him 'cause the key is in the guard's chamber, and
|14the guard's chamber is cursed. Only the Amulet can break the curse."
