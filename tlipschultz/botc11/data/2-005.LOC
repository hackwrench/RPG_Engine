You're at the southeast shallows of the Delidian Sea. A burly sailor in a
gray cloak stands before you, with his boat docked nearby. The shallows seem
to continue out to the west, but the water seems to be very deep in the north.
You can go south or east from here.

Hey, he's a ferryman! (T)alk to him if you want a ride across the sea!

The ferryman's boat. Don't touch unless you're a paying customer.
/
Seems pretty dang shallow to the west, like you could walk right through...
