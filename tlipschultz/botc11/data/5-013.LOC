Ack! Dead end! This particular forest path stretches to the east ONLY.

But it's also a...
|14                  ...Dance Party!

A voice echoes in your head...

|13Wyrdwad here. I am... the architect of this world, I suppose you could
|13say. Don't be frightened! I'm not here to hurt you. Actually, I'm here
|13to help. These strobe effects didn't exist in Vulteria ten years ago.
|13They're actually brand new. But... what is their purpose? Hmmm...
|13Perhaps you should try various things, and see what happens!

Yep. They're annoying, all right! Could they have something to do with
the rumors of alien abductions that pervade these woods? Or perhaps...
there's another purpose to them? Either way, they seem isolated to this
one, solitary forest path. Perhaps some experimentation may be in
order here...

NOW you understand... When the lights start dancing, it's only natural
that the body would start dancing as well! And what better way to dance...
than to ride the strobe?
