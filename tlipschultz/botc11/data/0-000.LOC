You're in a strange miasma of words and letters. The air looks like liquid
purple, but feels like a cool summer breeze. The precipice you're standing on
is small but sturdy, and you don't feel threatened at all by the thought of
falling from here. Although only letters exist around you, you know that you
can step north, west, east, or south and find yourself in one of the Shrines.
North is Shagwood, south is Eagle, east is Phorax, and west is Delidia.

The Wizard Glenlin stands before you -- speak with him before you leave.

He said he wanted to talk to you before you leave. He seems to be waiting for
you to finish looking around, with a sly grin adorning his handsome, manly
face. (:
/
It's very solid, and for some reason, doesn't feel threatening at all. You get
the idea that even falling from here would be... not that bad.

They seem to be forming words. The north letters, from brightest to darkest,
seem to spell "Shagwood". The south letters, "Eagle". The west, "Delidia". And
the east, "Phorax".

Since this screen is so unique and cool-looking, you can only assume it's the
height of achievement. Congratulations, you are now a true BotC Lamer. (:

|14"You've defeated The Chameleon -- that is why I've brought you to this
|14unnamed nebula which I consider to be my second home. The King of Teras has
|14sent his regards. He is very proud of you! But, remember, The Chameleon
|14never truly dies, so you can roam around and defeat him once again if you
|14wish. Or... you can search for the Vulteria Godbook. It's an ancient tome
|14that I wrote with my own hands. I know nothing of its location. I only know
|14that it exists, and that you could not have found it until now..."
