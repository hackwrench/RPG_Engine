[?7h[40m[2J[0;1;36m"You've done well, warrior."

[32mYou open your eyes. You're not dead, you're not swimming in gold, and you're
in the middle of a bizarre purple void, standing on a precipice, with words
and letters flowing through the air like seaweed on the ocean waves.
The man standing in front of you is [33mGlenlin[32m, the Terasian wizard who sent you
to Vulteria in the first place.

[36m"The four layers of dream were designed to test your skill and give you
confidence. You did not truly slay [31mThe Chameleon [36muntil just now. But, you
thought it was a dream, did you not? That, my friend, is what prevented you
from panicking -- and that may very well be what saved your life."

[32mGlenlin holds his hand out to you. A small vial of red liquid is in his palm.

[36m"This, my brave adventurer, is the [35mBlood of the Chameleon[36m. Take it, and use
it as you see fit. Your adventure is over now -- you may rest here, or you
may continue to fight. For you see, [31mThe Chameleon [36mnever truly dies, but
merely goes away for a time. He will be back, and you may defeat him again
to gain more of his blood. Examine your surroundings now, then speak with me
again -- I may have another quest for you, if you will receive it."
