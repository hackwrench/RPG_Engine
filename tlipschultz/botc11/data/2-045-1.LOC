My, what a busy room (in comparison to the others, anyway)! There's a villager
here, a firmly-shut bronze door in the east, and a strange feeling of extreme
openness. There are exits to the north and west (well, and a locked door to
the east).

Hmmm... what's that on the floor?

Bronze Door
Warped Floor

A typical villager. (T)alk, don't examine.
/
You need a Bronze Key to open this.
/
The floor is slightly warped, and it looks like there's something underneath
it...

|14"There exist the four elemental Tears: Golden, Ruby, Sapphire, and Crystal.
|14But, there are also two rare Tears as well: Rainbow and Prismatic. The rare
|14Tears can be absorbed into you. They will make you faster. The Rainbow Tear
|14will also insure that you never forget the four major attack spells, no
|14matter what happens. Likewise, the Prismatic Tear will insure that you never
|14forget the four major healing spells. But, there are rumors of a SEVENTH
|14Tear: Infinity. With it, you will never forget ANY spells you've learned."
