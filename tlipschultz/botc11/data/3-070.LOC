You've arrived at the Phorax Shrine, the only truly safe point in the entire
land. Speak often with the Phorax Guru (press T to talk), for he can heal you
when your health is low, teach you magic that will aid you in battle, and
cast a spell upon you that will return your body here as soon as death falls
upon you -- for yes, he can revive the dead, and he will aid you if you die.
Search the land for the 3 other gurus, as they offer the same service.

When you've finished here, you can leave the Shrine by going north (press 8).
